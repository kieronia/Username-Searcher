# Username-Searcher

This is a username searcher. 

Simply run the program, type the username and watch it find profiles with that username. 

If there are sites you wish to add, go to sites.txt, paste the site link acting like USERNAME is where the persons username would go, then a "," and a status code the site would respond to when doing a get request to a taken name

To remove a site simply delete it's line!

This is basically a copy of sherlock, but a bit easier to understand and should be easier to use!

Please only do it with permission and use it for good use. It is a demonstration project and I do not reccomend using it, it's simply here for you to learn about the request, threading and colorama module!
